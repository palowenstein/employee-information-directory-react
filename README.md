# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview
• Create a employee directory with React.
• Break up your application's UI into 1) components, 2) manage component state, 3) respond to user events.

## User Story
* Goal: View my entire employee directory at once for quick access to employee info.
* View non-sensitive data about other employees.


## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees.
It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
